This is just a simple tool I built to organize large batches of photos I've taken 
using their image file properties info (original time, date taken, date captured, 
etc...) and if those don't work, check file modification date/times.

The application works via drag'n'drop of the selected image files into the app, 
which will move the files into dated folder names your pictures folder.
